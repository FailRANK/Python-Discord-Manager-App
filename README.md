# Discord Manager App
This is a Discord manager app, composed of two python programs one that runs the bot and the other that controls the bot.
This is a simple easy to use app to control and run a discord bot in your personal server without the need to code it yourself!
The code itself is quite messy but the comments can help you in being able to modify the code to your liking.
